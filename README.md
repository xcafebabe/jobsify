Node-Red-Contrib Jobsify
========================

This is a node-red-contrib module to help me create email alerts with job searchs from different job website platforms.

Is it based on [maester](https://github.com/xcafebabe/maester)

Currently supported:
- https://weworkremotely.com/
- https://berlinstartupjobs.com/

For the moment the only way to install this node is in development mode.
