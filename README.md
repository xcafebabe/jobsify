Node-Red-Contrib Jobsify
========================

This is a node-red-contrib module to help me create email alerts with job searchs from different job website platforms.

Is it based on [maester](https://github.com/xcafebabe/maester)

Currently supporting:

- https://weworkremotely.com/
- https://berlinstartupjobs.com/

For the moment the only way to install this node is with some  development skills. If someone is interested to use/try it, please send
me an email to luis [at] toub.es.

Usage
-----
```
git clone https://github.com/xcafebabe/jobsify && \
cd jobsify && npm i gulp-cli -g && npm i && \
docker-compose up -d && \
firefox http://localhost:1880
```
